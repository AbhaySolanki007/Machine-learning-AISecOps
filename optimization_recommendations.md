# SOC AI System Optimization Recommendations

## Current Performance Summary
- **Attack Detection Rate**: 74.9% ✅ (Major improvement from 10.1%)
- **Critical Miss Rate**: 25.1% ⚠️ (Still needs improvement)
- **False Positive Rate**: 23.8% ⚠️ (High but acceptable trade-off)
- **Precision**: 28.6% ✅ (Major improvement from 0%)

## Priority Optimization Areas

### 1. **Reduce Miss Rate (25.1% → Target: <10%)**

#### A. Adjust Contamination Parameters
```python
# Current: contamination = 0.1
# Recommended: Try higher contamination for better attack detection
contamination_options = [0.15, 0.20, 0.25]

# For each model, adjust:
- OneClassSVM: nu parameter
- IsolationForest: contamination parameter  
- LOF: contamination parameter
```

#### B. Feature Engineering Enhancements
```python
# Add more attack-specific features:
- Temporal patterns (syscall sequences)
- Process tree relationships
- Network connection patterns
- File access patterns
- Memory allocation patterns
```

#### C. Model-Specific Tuning
```python
# IsolationForest adjustments:
- Increase n_estimators (500 → 1000)
- Adjust max_samples strategy
- Try different contamination values

# OneClassSVM adjustments:
- Try different kernels (poly, sigmoid)
- Adjust gamma parameter
- Fine-tune nu parameter

# LOF adjustments:
- Reduce n_neighbors (20 → 10-15)
- Try different distance metrics
```

### 2. **Reduce False Positive Rate (23.8% → Target: <15%)**

#### A. Threshold Optimization
```python
# Current fallback thresholds may be too aggressive
# Implement more sophisticated threshold selection:
- ROC curve analysis
- Precision-Recall curve optimization
- Cost-sensitive learning
```

#### B. Feature Selection
```python
# Remove or downweight features that contribute to false positives:
- Analyze feature importance
- Use recursive feature elimination
- Implement feature selection algorithms
```

#### C. Ensemble Weight Adjustment
```python
# Current weights: OCSVM(0.35), IForest(0.40), LOF(0.25)
# Optimize based on individual model performance:
- Cross-validation performance
- Individual model precision/recall
- Ensemble diversity analysis
```

### 3. **Improve Precision (28.6% → Target: >40%)**

#### A. Multi-Stage Classification
```python
# Implement two-stage detection:
1. First stage: High sensitivity (catch all attacks)
2. Second stage: High precision (filter false positives)
```

#### B. Attack Type Specific Models
```python
# Train specialized models for different attack types:
- Privilege escalation detection
- Process injection detection
- Network-based attack detection
- File system manipulation detection
```

#### C. Context-Aware Scoring
```python
# Incorporate contextual information:
- Process context (parent-child relationships)
- User context (privilege levels)
- System context (time, load, etc.)
- Network context (connections, protocols)
```
